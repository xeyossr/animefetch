**AnimeFetch** is a simple yet powerful tool that connects to the AniList API to retrieve and display detailed information about your favorite anime. Whether you need synopses, episode counts, release years, or ratings, AnimeFetch has you covered.

**Why build this?** Because I need to learn C++ and I couldn't think of any other project to do lol. Btw, C++ is awesome ðŸ”¥
